# BH1900NUX Breakout Board
*KiCad project files for a breakout board using the Rohm Semiconductor BH1900NUX temperature sensor.*

## Overview
The BH1900NUX breakout board simplifies integration of the **BH1900NUX sensor** into your projects.  
The main goal of this PCB is to fit into stainless steel sleeve of around 5mm diameter.  

### Features
-  **A1 pin** Supported (solder jumper on the back)
- **A2 pin** Supported (solder jumper on the back)
- **A3 pin** Supported (solder jumper on the back)
- **ALERT pin** NOT supported (Pin is not exposed on the PCB)

### JST SH connector pinout

| Pin # | Function |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | GND      |
| 2     | 3.3V     |
| 3     | SDA      |
| 4     | SCL      |

The pinout layout is widely used across different vendors of breakout boards with JST SH connector, allowing to use multiple different sensors on one bus more easily. Although the pin layout is (often) the same, each vendor uses their own brand names (e.g: STEMMA, μŠup)

> [!CAUTION]
> The design is not 5V compliant and 5V will destroy the sensor.  
> **Use 3.3V only.**
